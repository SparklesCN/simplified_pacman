** Project name:
	Simplified PacMan 

** Project repository:
	https://bitbucket.org/XiaodongQuan/simplified_pacman\

** Team members:
	Xiaodong Quan,
	Haihan Zhai

** Description:
	A simplified clone of the classic electronic game PacMan,
	Will trying to clone a graphics based on, visible game.
	Will trying to clone all the rules of the Traditional Version Pac-Man,
		like the powerful-cherry will help PacMan kill ghost.
	
	Will be multiple level layer if possible.

** Implementation approach:
	<Primary Language>: 
		C++ will be the primary (only) language during developement;
	<Third-Party Library>:
		Will develope the Pac-Man clone base on SDL2 library;
	<Team Coordination Approch>:
		For a 2 members small team, 
		One of us will focus on material implement & using, like show graphics in game windows;
		One of us will focus on logic layer.	
	<Time-Line>:
		Week6:
			Start learning the using of ThirdParty Lib "SDL2",
			Create basic visual windows & Start Menu;
		Wekk7:
			Collecting OpenSource Materials (Graphics, Backgrounds),
			Implement collected sources inside project, connect graphics with Objects;
				Logics:
					eat to get score logic,
					Ghost catching PacMan logic.
		Week8:
			Basic Game Demo,
			Without Power-Cherry, Without multiple level choose.
		Week9:
			Add Power-Cherry in
			(Will be a difficult part)
			& Ghost Escape Logic while PacMan got Power-Cherry
		Week10:
			Set multiple level if possible,
			better Ghost AI performance;
			Clean Compile Warning, 
			beautiful coding view.

			Complete Presentation;

** Risk management plan:
	Not Familiar with SDL2, 
	maybe some unknow confilic with developing environment (MAC OS),
	maybe some triky management with unix and linux system.

	Uncharted waters;
	Worst Case:
		Terminate the SDL2 based Pac-Man developing,
		Switch to ASC-II Game with implemented logics.
