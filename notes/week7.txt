  $ OutLine:
        Beta Version -> 
        {
          -> without the menu window;
          -> start game directly;
          -> only make pacman moveble without any AirWall limitedly;
        }

        To Do ->
        {
          -> Add game map;
              -> Create the AirWall;
          
          -> Make pacman moveble limited by AirWall;
          
          -> Create the Ghost object;
            -> create the logic of Ghost to catch PacMan automatically;
          
          -> limit the Ghost's movement by AirWall
        }
    
    -> Create a Window
    -> show the pacman image in the widow
    -> set the size
    -> make it moveble
